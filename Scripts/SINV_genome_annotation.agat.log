=> Accessing the feature_levels YAML file
Using standard /home2/2459810a/miniconda3/envs/iCLIP_analysis/lib/perl5/site_perl/auto/share/dist/AGAT/feature_levels.yaml file
=> Attribute used to group features when no Parent/ID relationship exists (i.e common tag):
	* locus_tag
	* gene_id
=> merge_loci option deactivated
=> Machine information:
	This script is being run by perl v5.32.1
	Bioperl location being used: /home2/2459810a/miniconda3/envs/iCLIP_analysis/lib/perl5/site_perl/Bio/
	Operating system being used: linux 
=> Accessing Ontology
	No ontology accessible from the gff file header!
	We use the SOFA ontology distributed with AGAT:
		/home2/2459810a/miniconda3/envs/iCLIP_analysis/lib/perl5/site_perl/auto/share/dist/AGAT/so.obo
	Read ontology /home2/2459810a/miniconda3/envs/iCLIP_analysis/lib/perl5/site_perl/auto/share/dist/AGAT/so.obo:
		4 root terms, and 2596 total terms, and 1516 leaf terms
	Filtering ontology:
The feature type (3rd column) is constrained to be either a term from the Sequence Ontology or an SO accession number. The latter alternative is distinguished using the syntax SO:000000. In either case, it must be sequence_feature (SO:0000110) or an is_a child of it.
We filter the ontology to apply this rule.		We found 1861 terms that are sequence_feature or is_a child of it.

WARNING - Feature types not expected by AGAT:
* mature_protein_region_of_cds
The feature of these types (3rd column in GFF3) are skipped by the parser!
To take them into account you must update the feature_levels YAML file. To acces
s this file run:
			agat levels --expose
In which file to add my feature?
* Feature level1 (e.g. gene, match, region):
  My feature has no parent
  => level1 section.
* Feature level2 (e.g. mrna, match_part, trna):
  My feature has one parent and children
  => level2 section.
* Feature level3 (e.g. exon, intron, cds):
  My feature has one parent (the parent has also a parent) and no children
  => level3 section.
* Feature level3 discontinuous (e.g. cds, utr):
  A single feature that exists over multiple genomic locations
  => spread section.
